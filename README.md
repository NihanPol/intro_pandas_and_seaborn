# intro_pandas_and_seaborn
An introduction to pandas and seaborn in Python

The data used in these notebooks comes from the [Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Tables.asp?DB_ID=120&DB_Name=Airline%20On-Time%20Performance%20Data&DB_Short_Name=On-Time) operated by the US Government. I have extracted the flight times for October, 2019 as an example case, which was the latest dataset available.
